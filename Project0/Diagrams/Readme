Main class: Inventory Manager

RUNNING THE APPLICATION

First the authenticator is ran and a session is made

Inventory manager starts off be creating all the views/models/observers/controllers needed (for the authenticated user)

the starting view of the application if the parts view

the menu at the top can toggle between the Inventory view (with parts and items) 
or template view (product template), if you have permission.

The parts view for a product template is the only view that works a bit oddly than the others, which should be pretty easy to understand.

In the parts view, parts must be added by typing in that parts part number and pressing "add", same with removing


HOW MODEL WORKS

model calls the GatewaySQL to deserialize the server data and creates a Map with the data, the items id the key

this was great for the start of this project, as it worked really well, but as the project continues it 
can get really tricky when we need to search for an item off another paramater, 
and I am slowly moving the application away from this approach, but for now, that part of the program
can be very spaghetti code at times.

Product model is much more up to date with most of the new approach (Still some changes to make)
 and should be pretty easy to understand

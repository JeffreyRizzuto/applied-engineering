Projects for applied-engineering

A README.txt file that explains your approach to this assignment, including your
team’s members. It should contain useful details for the grader that communicate your
design choices in satisfying the assignment’s requirements (e.g., 2 views embedded in
1 JFrame). Try to make it easy for the grader to understand how you fulfilled this
assignment’s requirements, especially if your choices are particularly clever or “special”.
